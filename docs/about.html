                    <h2>Current Trends and Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Recent trends in mobile GIS indicate that crowdsourcing applications are becoming more and more important in different industries. We believe that this process will occur in archaeological field prospection as well. In fact, smartphones have already become a popular tool for archaeological survey. But the question is whether the trend is headed into right direction? What are the threats and opportunities connected with the democratisation of such tools?</p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>The main goal of the SIG is to start a broad discussion on this topic amongst international experts with the aim of establishing standards and guidelines that may serve as "good practice" for Mobile GIS usage in archaeology.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Good Practice Topics</h2>
                    <p>Within "good practice" we would like to explore topics such as:</p>
                    <ul class="topics-list">
                        <li><strong>Why Mobile GIS is necessary for archaeology</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>What could be studied via Mobile GIS and how</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Efficient workflows for data collection</strong> of sites and other landscape elements (mobile applications)</li>
                        <li><strong>Using mobile GIS at different geographic scales:</strong> Intra-site and off-site</li>
                        <li><strong>Integration with other tools:</strong> GNSS, geodetic equipment, drones and sensors</li>
                        <li><strong>Ground-truth of collected data:</strong> Precision, accuracy and quality of crowdsourcing, and what is needed for collection of archaeological datasets</li>
                        <li><strong>Security of archaeological data:</strong> Data loss and theft; access of the data to the public; sharing of the data</li>
                        <li><strong>Crowd data collection:</strong> How to check the quality of collected data</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Technical Testing and Workshops</h2>
                    <p>Additionally, this group will be directly involved in technical testing of newly available applications that improve fieldwork efficiency and organize "hands-on" workshops.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Long-term Goals</h2>
                    <p>The long-term goal of the SIG is to try to influence the industry to create tools that archaeologists need. The SIG would also be directly involved in the development of new applications for archaeologists that could be used in field survey.</p>

                    <p>We encourage all interested CAA members to join the SIG. We hope that sharing our field survey experience will help to exchange ideas and standardize survey strategies that rely on Mobile GIS.</p>
