            "description": "Mobile GIS is a GIS for users who are on the move” (Lee 1993). Since its early adoption in archaeology (Pundt 2002; Tripcevich 2004), the technology has been celebrated for empowering archaeologists and communities, enabling efficient mapping and data collection even in underfunded, remote projects. Two decades on, Mobile GIS has become routine in fieldwork. This session asks: what does empowerment actually look like, and how can it be measured? We invite contributions that move beyond anecdote to critically evaluate the utility and durability of Mobile-GIS-based workflows in practice. Evidence-based comparisons—before and after a shift in toolkits, or between “in-the-field” and “in-the-office” workflows—are especially welcome. Evaluations might consider: reduced setup costs and administrative labour; technical debt and technical lock-in; ease of producing FAIR data; robust and low-maintenance data pipelines; improved team participation and community engagement (visible in data reuse, data compatibility with official registers, and other secondary benefits). Legal and regulatory contexts, where digital field records can function as admissible documentation, also form part of this evolving landscape. We also welcome methodological critiques that address the long-term sustainability of Mobile GIS practices. How resilient are current workflows to offline environments, overheated batteries, directorial tinkering, and emergent field realities, including volunteers taking pictures obsessively? What evidence demonstrates the scalability of these systems and their ability to generate rich, interoperable datasets for national and research archives? And as AI tools increasingly enter the discourse, what realistic role—if any—do they play in contexts where field conditions remain largely immune to network-dependent automation? We invite case studies, evaluations, and critiques that help the community take stock of where field data collection is today, and where it is heading.",

            "description": "Over the past decades, archaeological field surveys have significantly refined and adapted methodologies to suit various global contexts, from the Mediterranean and Near East to the Americas (Alcock and Cherry 2004; Bintliff, Howard, and Snodgrass 1999; Athanassopoulos and Wandsnider 2011; Banning 2002). In addition to the specific characteristics of each context, it is essential to reflect on the tools and techniques employed and how they are integrated into investigative methodologies. We can observe a gradual change from the site-oriented prospection into a more holistic approach, considering extended artifact scatters and the elusive remains of human presence in the landscape (Knodell et al. 2023). A significant focus was mapping the density of archaeological material between sites using systematic sampling or transects (Judge 1981; Binford 1975; Nance 1983). The integration of platforms, tools, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and artificial intelligence (AI) allows for multi-scale analysis, producing significant results through the possibility to analyze both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of archaeological data. These advancements enable researchers to better understand the relationship between different layers of information, leading to new insights into landscape archaeology and the complexities of past human-environment interactions. A pressing issue in archaeological surveys is the impact of intensive land use over time, which has led to the depletion of visible archaeological records on the surface. On the other hand, forested areas present unique challenges, as these environments—where archaeological remains might be better preserved—still lack optimized survey strategies (Mazzacca et al. 2022). As field conditions evolve, so too must our methodologies, adapting to account for both degraded landscapes and new technologies that open up a wide range of possibilities. The GNSS technologies and the expansion of portable handheld devices led to the development of what is currently known as Mobile GIS (Tripcevich 2004; Chyla and Buławka 2020; Sobotkova et al. 2015). It can be used for personal or collaborative work such as recording, monitoring, management, field verification, reporting, and didactics, which empowered archaeologists and cultural heritage authorities (Tibesasa 2021; Anbaroğlu et al. 2020; Abbas et al. 2023). It also changed the surface survey workflows and made systematic sampling or transects simpler and more accessible. This CAA Mobile GIS Special Interest Group meeting intends to create an environment for presenting and discussing the current projects. It focuses on the extended use of Mobile GIS integrated with other platforms and tools for mapping and monitoring sites, artifacts, and other types of tangible and intangible heritage. In this meeting, we aim to explore the following questions: What changes, benefits, or challenges has mobile technology brought to the overall field workflow? How has it impacted the data lifecycle and research publication or reporting process? How can Mobile GIS impact and empower communities of archaeologists from different countries and continents? How the Mobile GIS can protect heritage and mitigate its destruction or looting?",

            "description": "Mobile GIS Special Interest Group has in its previous CAA conference editions (2017, 2018, 2019, 2021) drawn attention to the importance of mobile GIS in archaeological and other field research, specifically its impact and contribution to fieldwork methodology and data collection (Buławka and Chyla, 2020; Sobotkova et al., 2021). In this edition, we survey how the use of mobile GIS in archaeology has progressed in recent years. In the early phase of COVID pandemic, Scerri et al. argued that sciences working in the field, including archaeology, had to change their ways (2021). The review of the recently published literature partly confirms it. As most international expeditions were canceled, scholars working in the field had to stop their projects. Many projects abandoned field work in favor of office work, for example remote sensing and data analysis. Others, in the late phase of the pandemic, found their way to continue working by novel methods of collaboration (Geser 2021; Magnani et al. 2021; Matte and Ulm 2021). COVID demonstrated the benefit of producing FAIR digital data in the field. Robust toolkit ensured that the collected data were born-digital, complete and consistent upon departure from fieldwork. Having all data shared and accessible by all team-members afterwards meant that work could continue remotely, which was a source of relief during the lockdown (Sobotkova et al., 2021). Additionally, we would like to explore the current differences in collaborative solutions between open-source and commercial software. Do the different OS and commercial software entail a different organization of archaeological fieldwork? What aspects and reasons lead a research team to choose an OS versus a commercial software? What is the range of funding models used to develop or deploy different mobile data capture applications? How should archaeologists prepare for OS updates, changes in hardware compatibility or application funding models so as to retain the ability to use the same workflow in the future? Another aspect that we would like to address at CAA 2023 is the capability to produce standardized results that follow good practice using mobile GIS nowadays. Some archaeologists report increased fieldwork efficiency thanks to the use of mobile devices (Austin 2014; Ames et al. 2020) while others focus on the downsides of the digital medium, such as deskilling, (Caraher 2016; Gordon et al. 2016), or stress the need to manage workplace change and fine-tune daily operation under the new circumstances (Vanvalkenburgh 2018). What makes the difference? Have the mobile devices transformed the entire lifecycle of archaeological research from team-based field data capture to analysis, sharing, and publishing, or affected only the day-to-day working processes in the field? And more specifically: is mobile GIS essential for digital fieldwork? If so, what are the must-have features of mobile GIS and how do you prioritize them? The session invites papers that may concern methodological and technical aspects and will be finished with a moderated discussion.",

            "description": "Archaeological field surveys, even the most intensive and systematic ones, cannot be considered flawless methods of acquiring data. Archaeological landscapes’ state of preservation, surface collection methods and agenda, visibility and personal preferences can affect the final results. It is not simply just the registration of observations, but a process of continuous interpretation starting from where to survey, what to collect, and how. Research conducted in the 1990s and early 2000s found  increasing precision in mapping and in the resolution of surveys  to be a solution to the most pressing problems in settlement pattern studies and landscape archaeology. Today, mapping precision does not seem to be a problem thanks to widely available portable GNSS equipment and specialized software dedicated to field data acquisition (Mobile GIS). Or is it? Reflection is needed on the technological advances of the past decades. What have archaeological  studies gained thanks to these technological achievements, and what are the implications of new, higher resolution data for crucial topics in scientific debate, such as complex societies? Currently, it is difficult to conduct field research because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is possible to step back and reflect on its theoretical and technical aspects of this methodology. The aim of this session is to continue the discussion of the changes that are happening in archaeological field prospection today, which we have been pursuing since CAA 2017 in Atlanta, through the Mobile GIS sessions. This session invites papers discussing broad interpretive and methodological aspects of landscape archaeology, settlement pattern studies, field survey (micro and macro scale) and Mobile GIS, theoretical or technical papers, and case studies from around the world. When submitting please specify if you want to present a long (15 minutes) or short (10 minutes) paper.",

            "description": "Have you ever wondered if it is possible to create field documentation using only your mobile phone? Can you imagine that you have just one tool to measure coordinates, take photos, create 3D models, plan your drone path and fill in the artefact database? Well, it seems that we are on the edge of a technological revolution: in the next few years, we are going to face a breakthrough in the GNSS technologies. In April 2018, India successfully launched its eighth satellite (IRNSS-1I), Galileo should have reached its full capability soon. The first GPS 3 satellite will be sent to the orbit. This next generation satellite is thought to introduce a fourth GPS signal (L1C). As David A. Turner – Deputy Director Office of OES/SAT - has pointed out, one of the key topics discussed in the modernization of GPS is to “encourage compatibility and interoperability among global and regional systems”. There is already a response to this in the smartphone industry as well: The BCM4775X is stated to be the first GNSS chip designed for smartphones to provide dual L1 and L5 frequency. Moreover, Android 7 OS has been equipped with tools to measure the carrier phase, which is a major ingredient in differential GPS. This capability is not available in every type of smartphone yet, but it is possible that future non-professional hardware could have better performance in GNSS. We are facing changes in the professional hardware as well, as the current operating system used for most PDAs is being withdrawn from the market and replaced by others. GPS signals are going to change from codeless into a modernized civil-coded transmission, which is not going to be usable by all equipment currently used by archaeologists. A new era of modernized GNSS is approaching. We can face it when it is there in the 2020s or we can start preparing for it now. This is the question behind this session in which we will discuss both technical and methodological problems of field surveys which exists today and might occur tomorrow. T his session will consist of short (10-15 minute) case-study papers (10-15 minutes) and a longer, final discussion, in which we would like presenters to address the issue from their research point of view. The main goal of the session is to engage in a broad discussion on this topic involving international experts with the aim of establishing standards and guidelines that may serve as “good practice” for Mobile GIS usage in archaeology. By “good practice” we aim to discuss topics such as:",

            "description": "The current trends in Geographic Information Systems hardware and applications suggest that Mobile GIS will be the main mapping tool for future surveying in different fields. Will it be also true for archaeology? Taking into account that the discipline has always followed technological trends, the answer is easy. We would like to discuss how the introduction of Geographic Information System and GNSS mobile applications available on gadgets of everyday use opened a new chapter in archaeological field survey techniques. The most valuable will be case studies and research projects. Thus, we would like to invite topics presenting not only possibilities, but also obstacles encountered during research. The goal of this session is to discuss not only problems which can occur in the field while working, but also to take a step back, and consider methodological approaches that are or should be used while using any type of device with any type of GIS application from a wide spectrum available nowadays. Encouraged by the success of last year’s session „Mobile GIS and field survey – current possibilities, future needs”, we would like to continue the discussion on the topic of possibilities in mobile GIS use on the field. We kindly invite all papers exploring the broad question “what is beyond the horizon” of Mobile GIS. Where does it lead us? How does it influence the methodology and field survey strategies?

            "description": "Field survey became an important method in researching ancient communities since A. Pitt Rivers. Ever since, we are dealing with the constant increase of theoretical and technical aspects of the discipline. With time, field surveys were gradually augmented with technological innovations - aerial photography, remote sensing and non-invasive prospection. The direction of development in archaeological prospection techniques depended on environment, types of sites, ways of landscape modifications and the focus of research. However, significant progress occurred through 1970s and 1980s, when scholars noticed that the pace of investigation was too slow to catch up with the destruction. Rapid urban sprawl and intensified agriculture production lead to increasing destruction of sites and entire archaeological landscapes, which could be observed throughout the globe, with some cases more pronounced than others:, Malta, Athens (Greece), Tunis (Tunisia), Paphos (Cyprus), the Nile Delta and Valley in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Peru and China. In many countries, archaeological heritage is constantly losing to economic growth in the competition for terrain and funding. Whereas in others, where heritage is a part of the economy, sites are looted for treasures. Another problem is the inaccessibility of the archaeological landscapes in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, because they became areas of conflict. In fact, it is not possible to list all the issues, which disturb or damage the field research today. Thus we need adequate low budget strategies, which could facilitate catching up with the destruction in order to preserve, study and manage what is left. The introduction of Geographic Information System and GNSS mobile applications available on gadgets of everyday use opened a new chapter in field survey techniques. It is possible nowadays to remotely manage and to track changes in a site from behind a desk. As a result, destruction prevention, management of preservation and reconstruction of sites and their regional contexts are accessible not only to specialist but also to general public, which, of course, raises a lot of new questions. The session invites papers discussing case studies from around the world, using different work-flows, and managing different problems. We hope that sharing our field survey experience will help to exchange ideas and standardize survey strategies.",
